## ?? Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Visual Studio
1. **Launch Visual Studio 2022** (Run as Administrator)
2. **File ? Open ? Project/Solution**
3. Navigate to this folder and open: **`Solidworks Automation.sln`**

### Step 2: Restore Packages
- Visual Studio should show a banner: **"Some NuGet packages are missing"**
- Click **"Restore"**
- Wait ~1-2 minutes

### Step 3: Build Core Libraries
1. In **Solution Explorer**, find **"ModelTools"**
2. Right-click ? **Build**
3. Check Output window ? Should say **"Build succeeded"**

4. Then build **"FileTools"**:
   - Right-click **"FileTools"** ? **Build**
   - Should succeed

### Step 4: Build Main Add-in
1. Right-click **"SolidWorks Add-In"** ? **Build**
2. Should build successfully!
3. Output window shows DLL location

### Step 5: Test in SolidWorks
1. Press **F5** in Visual Studio
2. SolidWorks will launch
3. Go to **Tools ? Add-Ins**
4. Look for **"Automation Guy"**
5. Check both boxes (load now + at startup)
6. You should see a task pane appear! ??

## ?? What You're Getting

This repository contains a **professional-grade** SolidWorks automation suite with:

### ??? Core Utilities
- **ModelTools** - SolidWorks model manipulation
- **FileTools** - File and assembly management
- **UserInterface** - UI components

### ?? Design Automation Tools
- **Hood** - Hood design automation
- **Plenum** - Plenum structure creation
- **Bundle** - Bundle assembly automation  
- **Structure** - Structural elements
- **Header** - Header design
- **MachineryMount** - Machinery mounting systems

- **Drawing Tools** - Automated drawing creation
- **Auto-Update System** - Version management
- **Task Pane UI** - Custom SolidWorks interface

---

## ?? Tips for Success

### Building
- ? Always run Visual Studio as **Administrator** (for COM registration)
- ? Build **ModelTools** first (other projects depend on it)
- ? Then build **FileTools**
- ? Then build the **main add-in**

### Debugging
- Press **F5** to launch SolidWorks with debugger attached
- Set breakpoints in code to step through execution
- Check Output window for debug messages

### Learning
- Start by exploring **ModelTools** code
- Read **FileTools** to see file operations
- Pick one design tool (Hood or Structure) to study
- Modify small things to understand the flow

## ?? Important Notes

### What Works:
? Building the projects  
? Loading the add-in  
? Task pane UI  
? Design automation tools  
? Drawing tools  

### What Won't Work (Company-Specific):
? Auto-update from PDM Vault (requires AXC_VAULT)  
? Template loading from company server  
? Some file paths (hardcoded to company structure)  

**These won't crash the add-in**, they just won't work without modification.

---

## ?? Learning Path

### Week 1: Get Familiar
- ? Build successfully
- ? Load in SolidWorks
- ? Explore the UI
- ? Run one of the design tools

### Week 2: Read Code
- Study ModelTools
- Study FileTools
- Pick one design tool and understand it
- Follow the code flow

### Week 3: Modify
- Make small UI changes
- Add debug messages
- Customize a feature
- Test your changes

### Week 4: Create
- Build your own automation
- Use the existing framework
- Add new features
- Share your work!

## ?? Troubleshooting

### Build Errors?
1. **Check Output window** for specific error messages
2. **Verify NuGet packages restored** (Solution ? Restore NuGet Packages)
3. **Run VS as Administrator** (required for COM registration)
4. **Check Error List** (View ? Error List)

### Add-in Won't Load?
1. **Check Tools ? Add-Ins** in SolidWorks
2. **Look for "Automation Guy"** in the list
3. **Check both boxes** (load + startup)
4. **Restart SolidWorks** if needed

### Missing References?
- All SolidWorks DLLs are in `Libraries/` folder
- If references are red, re-add them from Libraries folder
