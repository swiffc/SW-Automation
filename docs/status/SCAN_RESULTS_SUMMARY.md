## ? FAQ

**Q: Will this work on my system?**  
A: Yes, after applying the fixes. The code is solid, just needs configuration.

**Q: Do I need PDM Professional?**  
A: No. Unload the vault projects if you don't have it.

**Q: Is this better than the simple starter I created?**  
A: It's more complex. Simple starter = learn basics. This repo = learn production code.

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**  
A: Check the repository license. It's from a real company, so licensing may apply.

**Q: What SolidWorks version do I need?**  
A: Any recent version should work. May need to update interop DLLs for your version.
