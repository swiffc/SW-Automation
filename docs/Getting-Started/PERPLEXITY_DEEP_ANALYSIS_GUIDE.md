## ?? Real Output Example

### Sample from SCALING_ROADMAP.md:

```markdown
## ?? PHASE 1: Quick Wins (Weeks 1-4)

### 1. Implement Component Registry Pattern
**Why:** Reduces coupling, enables dynamic component loading
**Impact:** 30% faster to add new components
**Effort:** 8 hours
**Code:**
```csharp
public interface IComponentGenerator {
    string ComponentType { get; }
    void Generate(ComponentConfiguration config);
}

public class ComponentRegistry {
    private Dictionary<string, IComponentGenerator> _generators = new();
    
    public void Register<T>() where T : IComponentGenerator, new() {
        var generator = new T();
        _generators[generator.ComponentType] = generator;
    }
}
```

### 2. Add Batch Generation API
**Why:** Current system generates one at a time
**Impact:** 10x faster for multiple components
**Effort:** 12 hours
...
```

## ?? How Often to Run

### Recommended Schedule:

- **First time:** Run now to get your initial roadmap
- **Monthly:** Re-run to get latest techniques (web changes fast!)
- **Before major refactors:** Get current best practices
- **When stuck:** Search for specific solutions

### Why Monthly?

- New GitHub projects appear
- SolidWorks API best practices evolve
- Performance techniques improve
- Architecture patterns emerge

**The web is always updating - stay current!**

## ??? Security & Privacy

### Your Code Never Leaves Your Machine

- Only **project structure** is analyzed (file counts, component names)
- **No actual code** is sent to Perplexity
- **No proprietary information** is exposed

### What IS Sent:

```
"I have a SolidWorks automation project with:
- 22 C# projects
- 7 component types (Bundle, Header, Hood, etc.)
- 50,000 lines of C#
- Excel-driven configuration
- WPF/MVVM UI

How do I scale this to 50+ components?"
```

**That's it!** Generic, non-proprietary information only.

### API Keys Are Safe

- Stored in `.env` (never committed to Git)
- Listed in `.gitignore`
- Only accessible on your machine

## ?? Troubleshooting

### Error: "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not found"

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check .env file exists
Get-Content .env

# If missing, create it:
notepad .env

# Add:
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-key-here
```

### Error: "No module named 'requests'"

**Solution:**
```powershell
pip install requests
```

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution:**
- Wait 1 minute between runs
- Perplexity has generous limits (usually not an issue)

### Results Seem Generic?

**Solution:**
- The tool searches based on your project type
- If results seem off, the web research is still valuable
- Try individual searches (--performance, --testing, etc.)
