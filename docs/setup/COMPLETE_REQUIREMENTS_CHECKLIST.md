# Complete Requirements Checklist for SolidWorks Automation

**Status Check:** What you have vs. what you still need

---

## ? What You Already Have

Based on our work together:

- ? **Visual Studio 2022** - Installed
- ? **Repository Cloned** - GitHub repo downloaded
- ? **All Fixes Applied** - Code is ready to compile
- ? **Documentation Created** - Comprehensive guides ready
- ? **VSCode Configured** - Settings files created
- ? **Python Setup Files** - Scripts ready to run
- ? **VBA Templates** - Macro templates ready
- ? **Git** - For version control (optional but recommended)

---

## ? What You Still Need (Critical)

### 1. **SolidWorks Installation** ?? **REQUIRED**

**Status:** Need to verify if installed

**What You Need:**
- SolidWorks 2020 or newer (2023 recommended)
- **64-bit version** (most common)
- Standard, Professional, or Premium edition

**Check if you have it:**
```
Look for: C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS\SLDWORKS.exe
```

**If NOT installed:**
- Purchase/license from SolidWorks (Dassault Systèmes)
- Download from your company's software portal
- Or get an educational license (if student)

**Why Required:** 
- The entire automation suite works WITH SolidWorks
- Add-ins load INTO SolidWorks
- Cannot test or use without it

---

### 2. **SolidWorks API SDK** ?? **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**

**Status:** May not be installed

**What It Is:**
- API documentation and examples
- Additional development tools
- Not required for building, but needed for learning

**How to Get:**
- Included with SolidWorks installation media
- Or download from SolidWorks Customer Portal
- Look for "API SDK" or "API Help"

**Installation:**
- Run SolidWorks installer
- Select "API SDK" component
- Install to default location

**Why Needed:**
- Access API documentation (Help ? API Help in SolidWorks)
- Understand available methods and properties
- See code examples

---

### 3. **Administrator Rights** ?? **REQUIRED**

**For:**
- Running Visual Studio (COM registration)
- Installing software
- Registering add-ins

**Check:**
- Can you right-click ? "Run as Administrator"?
- Are you the computer administrator?

**If NO:**
- Contact your IT department
- May need elevated permissions for development

---

## ?? Optional But Recommended

### 4. **Python (if using Python automation)**

**Status:** May not be installed

**What You Need:**
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Installed with "Add to PATH" option

**Check if installed:**
```powershell
python --version
```

**If not installed:**
```
Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
During install: CHECK "Add Python to PATH"
```

**Then run our setup script:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\DCornealius\CascadeProjects\Solidworks_Automation
.\setup_python.ps1
```

**Why Useful:**
- Alternative to VBA for automation
- Better for batch processing
- Easier to integrate with other systems

---

### 5. **.NET Framework 4.8** ? **Probably Have**

**Status:** Usually pre-installed on Windows 10/11

**Check:**
- Go to Settings ? Apps ? Optional Features
- Look for ".NET Framework 4.8"

**If NOT installed:**
```
Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48
Install the Developer Pack
```

**Why Needed:**
- Required for C# projects
- Usually already on Windows

---

### 6. **PDM Professional** ? **NOT NEEDED**

**Status:** Don't need it

**What It Is:**
- Enterprise Product Data Management
- Vault system for file management

**Do You Need It?**
- ? **NO** - Already disabled in our fixes
- Only needed if you want vault features
- Most users don't have it

---

### 7. **Excel (Microsoft Office)** ?? **Optional**

**Status:** Unknown

**What It's For:**
- Excel integration features in the automation
- Importing/exporting data

**Do You Need It?**
- ?? Only if using Excel import features
- Most automation works WITHOUT it
- Can skip if you don't need Excel integration

---

## ?? Development Tools (You Already Have)

### Already Installed: ?

1. **Visual Studio 2022** ?
   - With .NET desktop development workload
   - Ready to build C# projects

2. **VSCode** ?
   - For viewing/editing files
   - Configured with proper settings

3. **Git** ? (if you cloned the repo)
   - For version control
   - Optional but useful

---

## ?? Complete Setup Checklist

### Critical (Must Have):
- [ ] **SolidWorks installed and licensed**
- [ ] **Visual Studio 2022 installed**
- [ ] **Administrator rights on computer**
- [ ] **Repository cloned and fixes applied** ? (Done!)

### Highly Recommended:
- [ ] **SolidWorks API SDK installed**
- [ ] **.NET Framework 4.8** (probably already have)
- [ ] **Run Visual Studio as Administrator** (for COM registration)

### Optional:
- [ ] **Python 3.11+** (if using Python automation)
- [ ] **Microsoft Excel** (if using Excel features)
- [ ] **Git for Windows** (if modifying code)

---

## ?? Next Steps Based on Your Status

### If You HAVE SolidWorks:

**You're ready! Do this:**

1. **Open Visual Studio 2022 as Administrator**
2. **Open:** `Solidworks Automation.sln`
3. **Restore NuGet packages**
4. **Build:** ModelTools ? FileTools ? SolidWorks Add-In
5. **Press F5** to test in SolidWorks

---

### If You DON'T HAVE SolidWorks:

**You need to get it first:**

1. **Purchase/License SolidWorks**
   - https://www.solidworks.com/
   - Contact sales or your company's IT

2. **Install SolidWorks**
   - Include API SDK component
   - Full installation (not viewer)

3. **Then come back and build the add-in**

**Alternative for Learning:**
- Can still study the code without SolidWorks
- Won't be able to test/run the automation
- But excellent for learning C# and automation patterns

---

## ?? Quick Decision Tree

**Do you have SolidWorks installed?**
- ? **YES** ? You're ready! Open Visual Studio and build!
- ? **NO** ? Install SolidWorks first (required)

**Do you want to use Python automation?**
- ? **YES** ? Run `setup_python.ps1` script
- ? **NO** ? Skip Python, just use C# add-in

**Do you have Administrator rights?**
- ? **YES** ? Perfect! You're all set
- ? **NO** ? Contact IT for elevated permissions

---

## ?? Minimum Requirements Summary

### To BUILD the projects:
1. ? Visual Studio 2022 (you have this)
2. ? .NET Framework 4.8 (probably have)
3. ? Repository with fixes (you have this)

### To RUN the add-in:
1. ? **SolidWorks installed** (need to verify)
2. ? Projects built successfully
3. ? Administrator rights (need to verify)

### To DEVELOP & TEST:
1. All of the above
2. ?? SolidWorks API SDK (recommended)
3. ?? Python (if using Python features)

---

## ?? What to Do If Missing Something

### Missing SolidWorks?
**Option A:** Install it (required for running)
**Option B:** Study code only (learning without testing)

### Missing API SDK?
**Option A:** Install from SolidWorks media
**Option B:** Use online API documentation

### Missing Python?
**Option A:** Install Python + run setup script
**Option B:** Just use C# and VBA (Python optional)

### Missing Admin Rights?
**Option A:** Contact IT for permissions
**Option B:** Build on another computer with admin rights

---

## ? You're Probably Ready If...

You have these 3 things:
1. ? **SolidWorks installed** (licensed and working)
2. ? **Visual Studio 2022** (as Administrator)
3. ? **This repository** (with fixes applied)

**Everything else is optional or already set up!**

---

## ?? Quick Status Check Commands

Run these to verify what you have:

```powershell
# Check SolidWorks
Test-Path "C:\Program Files\SOLIDWORKS Corp\SOLIDWORKS\SLDWORKS.exe"

# Check Python (optional)
python --version

# Check .NET Framework
Get-ChildItem "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full\" | Get-ItemProperty -Name Release
```

---

## ?? Bottom Line

### What You DEFINITELY Need:
1. **SolidWorks** (CRITICAL - verify you have it)
2. **Visual Studio 2022** (? You have this)
3. **Repository** (? You have this)

### What's Nice to Have:
- API SDK (for documentation)
- Python (for Python automation)
- Excel (for Excel features)

### What You DON'T Need:
- ? PDM Professional (disabled)
- ? Company infrastructure (worked around)
- ? Special plugins (all included)

**Most likely, you just need to verify SolidWorks is installed, then you're good to go!** ??
