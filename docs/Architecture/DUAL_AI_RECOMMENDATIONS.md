(See TOOL_SELECTOR_RESEARCH.md for full details)

**Summary**:
- Two-level navigation pattern
- Used by Fusion 360, Visual Studio, Siemens NX, CATIA
- Single window with dynamic content
- Context-driven UI

## ?? OpenAI Project Analysis

### 1. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Tool Selector Structure
Implement a two-level navigation system:
- **First Level:** A landing page or a sidebar for selecting the tool type (Header Section, XCH Structure, Z Structure, Hudson Certified).
- **Second Level:** Dynamically generated tabs for components or specific workflows within the selected tool.

#### MVVM Pattern
Use a more modular MVVM approach to facilitate dynamic content loading and separation of concerns:
- **ViewModelLocator** for dependency injection and ViewModel resolution.
- **DynamicViewModelBase**: A base ViewModel that can load different child ViewModels based on the selected tool.

#### Handling Excel Configs
For the 37 Excel configs in the Header Section Tool:
- Use a **ConfigurationManager** service that dynamically loads and parses Excel files based on the selected component.
- Implement caching to avoid reloading configs already in memory.

#### Hudson Certified Workflow
Given its different workflow:
- Integrate it within the UnifiedUI but isolate its process flow using a dedicated ViewModel and services.

### 2. ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

#### Hudson Certified Window Integration
Integrate Hudson Certified into the main window to maintain the UnifiedUI concept, using a separate ViewModel for its unique workflow.

#### Managing Z Structure Templates
- Implement a **TemplateLoader** service that asynchronously loads templates on demand to reduce initial load time.
- Use a background worker or async-await pattern to prevent UI freezing.

#### Switching Between Tools Without Memory Leaks
- Implement IDisposable in ViewModels and Services to properly release COM objects.
- Use weak event patterns for event handling to avoid memory leaks.

#### Handling Tool-Specific Excel Configs
- Use a factory pattern in ConfigurationManager to return the correct parser and loader for the specific tool's Excel config.

### 3. CODE STRUCTURE

#### Class Hierarchy
- **ViewModels**
  - MainViewModel
  - ToolViewModelBase : DynamicViewModelBase
    - HeaderSectionViewModel
    - XCHStructureViewModel
    - ZStructureViewModel
    - HudsonCertifiedViewModel
- **Services**
  - SolidWorksService
  - TemplateManager
  - ConfigurationManager

#### ViewModel Organization
- **MainViewModel** holds the current tool ViewModel and handles tool switching logic.
- **ToolViewModelBase** provides common functionality for tool-specific ViewModels.

#### Service Layer Changes
- Decouple **SolidWorksService** into more granular services for better single responsibility adherence (e.g., DrawingService, AssemblyService).

#### XAML Layout Recommendations
- Use a `<ContentControl>` bound to the current tool ViewModel for dynamic content loading.
- Implement a sidebar with buttons or a ComboBox for tool selection.

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

#### Build Order
1. Tool selection mechanism (first-level navigation).
2. Dynamic tab creation for the Header Section Tool (second-level navigation).
3. ConfigurationManager for handling Excel configs.
4. TemplateLoader service for Z Structure templates.

#### Deferred Items
- Advanced caching mechanisms for Excel configs and CAD templates can be refined later.

#### Critical Path Items
- Tool selection UI and logic.
- Dynamic ViewModel loading.

### 5. POTENTIAL ISSUES

#### COM Memory Leaks
- Use Marshal.ReleaseComObject judiciously when done with SolidWorks objects.
- Implement a robust IDisposable pattern in all ViewModels and Services interacting with COM objects.

#### Handling Unsaved Data
- Implement a dirty check in each ViewModel. Prompt the user to save changes when switching tools or closing the application.

### 6. COMPARISON TO PERPLEXITY FINDINGS

#### Two-Level Navigation Agreement
- Agree with the two-level navigation pattern. It's intuitive and aligns with industry standards, providing a clear and scalable UI structure.

#### Modifications for This Project
- Given the complexity and size of CAD templates, implement lazy loading and asynchronous operations wherever possible to enhance performance.

#### SolidWorks COM Interop Considerations
- Ensure all COM objects are properly released.
- Consider using a Singleton pattern for the SolidWorks application object to avoid multiple instances and ensure consistent state management.

This approach balances the need for a unified, dynamic UI with the technical requirements of handling large CAD files and complex configurations, laying a solid foundation for a scalable and maintainable application.

## ?? COMBINED RECOMMENDATIONS

Both AIs agree on:
1. Two-level navigation (tool selector ? components)
2. Single window with dynamic views
3. MVVM with tool-specific ViewModels
4. Proper COM cleanup on tool switching
