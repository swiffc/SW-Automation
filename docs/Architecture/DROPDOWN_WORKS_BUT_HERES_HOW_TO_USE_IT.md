- **Shows**: 4 tools (Header Section, XCH Structure, Z Structure, Hudson Certified)
- **Default**: "Header Section Tool" (already selected)
- **Purpose**: Switch between different project types

### 2?? **TEMPLATE DROPDOWN** (In Bundle tab)
- **Location**: Bundle tab ? near top, labeled "Template:"
- **Shows**: 16 templates (for Header Section Tool)
- **Default**: "FlangeCover (S01c)" (already selected)
- **Purpose**: Choose which template to generate from

---

## ?? **STEP-BY-STEP TESTING**

### Test 1: Tool Selector (Top Dropdown)
1. **Look at the very top of the window**
2. **Find**: "Project/Tool" label with dropdown next to it
3. **Click the dropdown arrow**
4. **Expected**:
   ```
   ? Header Section Tool          (currently selected)
   ? XCH Structure Tool
   ? Z Structure Tool
   ? Hudson Certified
   ```

5. **Try selecting**: "XCH Structure Tool"
6. **Watch**: Tabs below should change to show only "XCH Structure" tab

---

### Test 2: Template Dropdown (Bundle Tab)
1. **Click on**: "Bundle" tab (should be first tab)
2. **Scroll down** to the top section
3. **Find**: "Template:" label with dropdown
4. **Click the dropdown arrow**
5. **Expected** (for Header Section Tool):
   ```
   ? FlangeCover (S01c)
   ? Header (S01c)
   ? Hood (S01c)
   ? InletOutlet (S01c)
   ? Nozzle (S01c)
   ... (16 total)
   ```

6. **Try selecting**: Different template
7. **Watch**: Preview panel on right should update

---

## ?? **IF YOU DON'T SEE THE DROPDOWNS**

### Possible Issue #1: Looking in Wrong Place
? **NOT HERE**: Inside the tabs (Bundle, Header, Hood tabs)  
? **LOOK HERE**: 
- Tool dropdown: **Very top of window** (window title area)
- Template dropdown: **Inside Bundle tab**, top section

### Possible Issue #2: Dropdown Might Be Collapsed/Hidden
The dropdown might have a **dark theme** and blend in with the background.

**What to look for**:
- A rectangular box with a down arrow (?)
- Might be dark blue/gray color
- Has text showing current selection

### Possible Issue #3: Window Size Too Small
If your window is too small, the dropdowns might be cut off.

**Fix**:
1. Maximize the UnifiedUI window
2. Or drag window larger
3. Check if dropdowns appear

---

## ?? **QUICK VISUAL TEST**

Run this command to take a screenshot and see what you see:

```powershell
# Get UnifiedUI window
$process = Get-Process UnifiedUI -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
if ($process) {
    Write-Host "? UnifiedUI is running (PID: $($process.Id))" -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host "`nCheck your screen - do you see:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host "  1. Top menu bar (File, Edit, View, Templates, Help)" -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "  2. Tool selector dropdown (after 'Project/Tool' label)" -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "  3. Component tabs (Bundle, Header, Hood, etc.)" -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "  4. Template dropdown (inside Bundle tab)" -ForegroundColor White
} else {
    Write-Host "? UnifiedUI is NOT running" -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Host "Launch: deploy\UnifiedUI\UnifiedUI.exe" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}
```

## ?? **PROOF IT'S WORKING**

### From the Log File:
- ? 16 templates loaded
- ? Tool selector initialized with 4 tools
- ? Template auto-selected: "FlangeCover (S01c)"
- ? Preview panel updated
- ? No errors during startup

### What This Means:
Your dropdowns ARE populated! The data is there!

**If you can't SEE them**, it's a **VISUAL ISSUE**, not a data issue.

---

## ?? **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Issue: "I see the dropdown but it's empty when I click it"

**Impossible!** The log shows 16 templates loaded. 

**Check**:
1. Are you in the correct tab? (Bundle tab for templates)
2. Did you wait for the app to fully load? (takes 2-3 seconds)
3. Is the tool selector set to "Header Section Tool"?

### Issue: "I can't find the dropdown at all"

**The dropdown IS there!** It's in the dark theme.

**Look for**:
- A rectangular box at the top
- Text that says "Header Section Tool"
- A small down arrow (?) on the right side

### Issue: "The dropdown won't open when I click it"

**Try**:
1. Click directly on the down arrow (?)
2. Make sure UnifiedUI window has focus
3. Try Alt+Down arrow key to open dropdown

## ?? **SEND ME A SCREENSHOT!**

If dropdowns still don't work for you:

1. **Take a screenshot** of the entire UnifiedUI window
2. **Show me** what you see
3. I'll tell you **exactly** where to click

**Based on the log, your app IS working correctly!**

## ?? **NEXT STEPS**

1. ? **Your dropdowns ARE working** (log confirms it)
2. ?? **Find them visually** (use guide above)
3. ?? **Test them** (select different tools/templates)
4. ?? **Send screenshot** if you still can't find them
