# Tool Selector UI/UX Research

**Generated**: Auto-research via Perplexity

For your WPF/MVVM SolidWorks automation app that manages **4 different tool types** with distinct configurations, components, templates, and workflows, applying proven **UI/UX patterns** tailored to complex, multi-project engineering apps is critical. Below are specific recommendations addressing your questions with real-world parallels and best practices:

---

### 1. Top-Level Tool/Project Selector

**Best practice:** Use a **prominent, immediate selection control for choosing the active tool/project** *before* diving into configuration details.

- **Pattern: Dropdown or segmented control at the top toolbar or main landing page**
  - Shows all 4 tools clearly with icons or names ("Header Section", "XCH Structure", etc.)
  - Selecting a tool dynamically loads its specific UI and configuration components to prevent confusion and reduce UI clutter.
- **Example from CAD and engineering tools:**
  - Autodesk Fusion 360 uses a **workspace switcher** at the top, letting users pick different workspaces or project types before showing relevant tools.
  - Visual Studio shows a **solution/project selector** in the toolbar, filtering tool windows and tabs based on the selected context.
- **Implementation tip (WPF/MVVM):**
  - Bind a `SelectedTool` property in your main ViewModel.
  - Use an `ItemsControl` or `ComboBox` bound to a `Tools` collection.
  - Changing `SelectedTool` triggers loading of the tool-specific ViewModels and views via DataTemplates or user controls dynamically injected in a ContentControl.

### 2. Organizing Tabs and Navigation

**Best practice:** Nest navigation hierarchically:
  
- **Primary navigation:** Switch between **tool types** (via top-level selector or navigation menu).
- **Secondary navigation:** Within the selected tool, use **tabs or a side navigation pane** for components/configuration areas (e.g., Bundle, Header, Hood).
- Avoid mixing all tool components into a single flat tab bar — this becomes overwhelming with dozens of tabs.

**UI Patterns:**

| Navigation Level             | Recommended Control             | Rationale                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Tool selection              | Top-level ComboBox or Ribbon segmented buttons | Clears ambiguity on which tool is active      |
| Components inside a tool    | TabControl or vertical NavigationView (like side menu) | Organizes component workflows logically       |
| Large or complex config UI  | Nested accordions, expandable sections, or flyouts | Reduces clutter, groups related settings      |

**CAD app examples:**

- **Inventor and CATIA** use workspace tabs or panels that appear contextually based on the active project/tool.
- **Siemens NX** offers ribbon-style workspace switching with contextual tabs.
- **Visual Studio** uses solutions (tools/projects) top-level with document tabs inside—relevant since it manages many project types similarly.

### 3. Single Window vs. Multiple Windows

**Best practice:** Use a **single main window** with dynamic views (ContentControl or MVVM DataTemplates) to host different tools.

- Consistent user experience — users don’t lose context.
- Simplifies state management (only one window to track).
- Easier to maintain for MVVM binding, commands, and centralized services.
- Use **modal dialogs or flyouts for minor workflows** if needed.

**When multiple windows may be justified:**

- If Hudson Certified tool has a *completely different workflow* and advanced customization, it could be a separate window launched from the main app.
- Otherwise, unify to ease user workflow switching and reduce cognitive load.

CAD apps like Fusion 360 and Inventor rely largely on a **single-window interface with dockable panels and tabbed documents**, not multiple independent windows per tool.

### 4. How Enterprise CAD Apps Handle Multiple Tools/Projects

- **Context-driven UI:** Select workspace/project upfront, then UI adapts.
- **Tabbed or ribbon interface:** Separate functionality grouped by active context.
- **Dynamic loading:** Load tool-specific modules dynamically to reduce clutter.
- **Customizable workspace/panels:** Users can pin, hide, or arrange components per workflow.
- **Example references:**
  - **Autodesk Fusion 360**: Workspace selector at top-left, context-dependant panels.
  - **Dassault CATIA**: Workbenches selected per project, UI elements updated accordingly.
  - **Siemens NX:** Ribbon tabs and menus reflect active module/project choice.
  - **Visual Studio:** Solution/project selector with dynamic document and tool windows.

### Code / MVVM Implementation Suggestions

```xml
<!-- Tool Selector ComboBox in MainWindow.xaml -->
<ComboBox ItemsSource="{Binding Tools}"
          SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedTool}"
          DisplayMemberPath="Name"
          Margin="10"
          HorizontalAlignment="Left"/>

<!-- Dynamic Content presenting selected tool's config views -->
<ContentControl Content="{Binding SelectedToolViewModel}">
  <ContentControl.Resources>
    <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type vm:HeaderSectionToolViewModel}">
      <views:HeaderSectionToolView />
    </DataTemplate>
    <DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type vm:XCHStructureToolViewModel}">
      <views:XCHStructureToolView />
    </DataTemplate>
    <!-- Add others similarly -->
  </ContentControl.Resources>
</ContentControl>
```

- Each *ToolViewModel* hosts component tab management.
- Use `TabControl` bound to `ObservableCollection<ComponentViewModel>` inside the tool views.
- Loading templates dynamically reduces upfront UI complexity and respects MVVM separation [1][2][5].

### Summary of Best Practices for Your App

- Present a **clear, top-level tool selector** before component configuration.
- Organize navigation with **nested tabs or side panels** inside the selected tool’s UI.
- Prefer a **single window app** hosting all tools, with dynamic views for clarity and ease of testing.
- Model your navigation similar to **modern CAD apps and Visual Studio**: context-driven, adaptive UI that loads relevant views to avoid overwhelming users.
- Leverage WPF/MVVM patterns for clean separation and dynamic view composition ensuring long-term maintainability and testability [1][2][5].
